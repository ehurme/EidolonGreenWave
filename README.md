## Overview
Straw-colored fruit bats (<i>Eidolon helvum</i>) migrate across sub-Saharan Africa, yet their seasonal colony dynamics have not been studied at a continental scale. Using long-term colony counts, we provide the first evidence of bats tracking the “green wave” during their migration. The match between peak colony size and peak rate of green up increased in seasonal landscapes and with larger colonies, suggesting that these bats might be using collective sensing for detecting landscape changes.
